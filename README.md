# Express.js Async Route 404 Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js asynchronous routes and its proper solution.

## The Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a 404 error is not handled correctly in an asynchronous route.  If the database operation fails to find a user, the response might not be sent properly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or incomplete responses. 

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the proper way to handle 404 errors in asynchronous Express.js routes, ensuring that appropriate error responses are always sent to the client.
